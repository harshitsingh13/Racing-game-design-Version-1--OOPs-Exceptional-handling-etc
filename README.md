# Racing-game-design-OOPs-Exceptional-handling-etc

Like I said, this is a racing game, and like any other racing game there are obstacles and freebies
on your race track. For implementing this game I use inheritance, polymorphism,
exception handling, and define your own exceptions. We have given the names of those
exceptions as well in the sample test case.

The game starts with the user entering the total number of tiles on the race track. Each tile
represents one position in one dimension. A tile can be of type Snake, Vulture, Cricket, White,
or Trampoline. This is a single player game and once the game starts, its the computer who
plays the game without any user intervention, and continues playing until the player wins.
